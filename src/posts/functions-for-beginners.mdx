Functions are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to encapsulate a block of code that can be reused. In Python, defining and using functions is straightforward.

### Defining a Function

To define a function in Python, use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses `()`. You can also specify parameters inside the parentheses if your function needs inputs.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
  {`
    def greet(name):
        """Function to greet a person by name."""
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

### Calling a Function

Once defined, you can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses `()`.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
  {`
    greet("Alice")
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

### Return Statement

Functions can also return values using the \`return\` statement. This allows functions to compute a result that can be used elsewhere in your code.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
  {`
    def add(a, b):
        """Function to add two numbers."""
        return a + b

    result = add(3, 5)
    print("The sum is:", result)
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

### Conclusion

Functions are essential for organizing code and promoting reusability in Python. As you learn more, you'll discover their power in creating modular and efficient programs.
