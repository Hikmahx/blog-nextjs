Variables are fundamental to any programming language, and Python is no exception. They allow you to store and manipulate data within your code.

## What is a Variable?

A variable in Python is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a Python program gives data to the computer for processing.

## Declaring Variables

In Python, you do not need to declare a variable with a specific type. You simply assign a value to a variable, and Python automatically knows the type of the value. Hereâ€™s how you can declare a variable in Python:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
{`
  # Integer
  x = 5

  # Float
  y = 3.14

  # String
  name = "John"
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Variable Naming Rules

When naming variables in Python, there are several rules you need to follow:

1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
2. The rest of the variable name can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.
3. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables).

## Example

Here is an example of how to use variables in Python:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
{`
  # Assigning values to variables
  a = 10
  b = 20

  # Performing arithmetic operations
  sum = a + b
  difference = a - b
  product = a * b
  quotient = a / b

  # Printing the results
  print("Sum:", sum)
  print("Difference:", difference)
  print("Product:", product)
  print("Quotient:", quotient)
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Conclusion

Understanding variables is crucial for any beginner in Python. They are the building blocks for creating more complex programs and allow you to store and manipulate data efficiently.
